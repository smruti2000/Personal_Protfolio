    <br><br>

    <b>23. Define Aggregate functions. </b><br>
    <b>A. </b>Functions which operate against a collection of values and returning single value is called aggregate functions
    <br><br>

    <br><br>

    <b>40. Explain the importance of partitioning. </b><br>
    <b>A. </b>Splitting of one table which is large into smaller database entities logically is called database partitioning.<br>
    Its benefits are: To improve query performance in situations dramatically when mostly rows which are heavily accessed are in one partition.
    Accessing large parts of a single partition slower and cheaper storage media can be used for data which is seldom used.
    <br><br>

    <b>41. Define Database system. </b><br>

    <b>44. Define Atomicity and Aggregation. </b><br>
    <b>A. </b>Atomicity: It‚Äôs an all or none concept which enables the user to be assured of incomplete transactions to be taken care of. The actions involving incomplete transactions are left undone in DBMS.<br>
    Aggregation: The collected entities and their relationship are aggregated in this model. It is mainly used in expressing relationships within relationships.
    <br><br>
