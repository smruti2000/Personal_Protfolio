Due to this, only the replies are allowed i.e if the traffic is Generated from inside the network then only the replies (of inside network traffic) coming from outside the network is allowed.<br>
              Cisco IOS router can be made firewall through two methods:
    <ul>
      <li>By using CBAC: create an access list and apply it to the interfaces keeping in mind what traffic should be allowed or denied and in what direction. This has an extra overhead for the administrator.</li>

    <br><br>

    <b>29. What is VPN?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>VPN stands for the virtual private network. A virtual private network (VPN) is a technology that creates a safe and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. A Virtual Private Network is a way to extend a private network using a public network such as the internet. The name only suggests that it is a Virtual “private network” i.e. user can be part of a local network sitting at a remote location. It makes use of tunneling protocols to establish a secure connection.

    <br><br>

    <b>31. What is a Tunnel mode?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>This is a mode of data exchange wherein two communicating computers do not use IPSec themselves. Instead, the gateway that is connecting their LANs to the transit network creates a virtual tunnel that uses the IPSec protocol to secure all communication that passes through it. Tunnel mode is most commonly used between gateways, or at an end-station to a gateway, the gateway acting as a proxy for the hosts behind it. Tunnel mode is most commonly used to encrypt traffic between secure IPSec gateways, such as between the Cisco router and PIX Firewall.
    <br><br>

    <b>32. Define Digital Signatures?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>As the name sounds are the new alternative to sign a document digitally. It ensures that the message is sent to the intended use without any tampering by any third party (attacker). In simple words, digital signatures are used to verify the authenticity of the message sent electronically.<br>
          or we can say that – A digital signature is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software, or digital document.
    <br><br>

    <b>33. What is Authorization?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>Authorization provides capabilities to enforce policies on network resources after the user has gained access to the network resources through authentication. After the authentication is successful, authorization can be used to determine what resources is the user allowed to access and the operations that can be performed.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>

    <b>41. Can IP Multicast be load-balanced?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>No, The ip multicast multipath command load splits the traffic and does not load balance the traffic. Traffic from a source will use only one path, even if the traffic far outweighs traffic from other sources.
    <br><br>

    <b>42. What is Multicast?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>Multicast is a method of group communication where the sender sends data to multiple receivers or nodes present in the network simultaneously. Multicasting is a type of one-to-many and many-to-many communication as it allows sender or senders to send data packets to multiple receivers at once across LANs or WANs. This process helps in minimizing the data frame of the network.
    <br><br>

    <b>43. What is a reverse proxy?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>Reverse Proxy Server: The job of a reverse proxy server to listen to the request made by the client and redirect to the particular web server which is present on different servers. This is also used to restrict the access of the clients to the confidential data residing on the particular servers.
    <br><br>

    <b>44. What is the role of address in packet traveling through a datagram network?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>The address field in a datagram network is end-to-end addressing.
    <br><br>

    <b>45. Can a routing table in the datagram network have two entries with the same destination address?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>No. routing tables in the datagram network have two entries with the same destination address, not possible because the destination address or receiver address is unique in the datagram network.
    <br><br>

    <b>46. What kind of arithmetic is used to add data items in checksum calculation?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>To add data items in checksum calculations, one’s complement arithmetic is used
    <br><br>

    <b>47. Define piggybacking?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>A technique called piggybacking is used to improve the efficiency of the bidirectional protocols. When a frame is carrying data from A to B, it can also carry control information about arrived (or lost) frames from B; when a frame is carrying data from B to A, it can also carry control information about the arrived (or lost) frames from A.
    <br><br>

    <b>48. What are the advantages and disadvantages of piggybacking?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>The major advantage of piggybacking is better use of available channel bandwidth.<br>
          The major disadvantage of piggybacking is additional complexity and if the data link layer waits too long before transmitting the acknowledgment, then re-transmission of the frame would take place.
    <br><br>

    <b>49. Which technique is used in byte-oriented protocols?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>A byte stuffing is used in byte-oriented protocols. A special byte is added to the data section of the frame when there is a character with the same pattern as the flag.
    <br><br>

    <b>50. What are the two main categories of DNS messages?</b><br>
    <b>A. </b>The two categories of DNS messages are queries and replies.
